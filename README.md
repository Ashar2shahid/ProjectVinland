# ProjectVinland

Project Vinland is an onchain metaverse game in which users, when signed in by their Metamask/wallet, 
can tour the DeFi metaverse which has multiple stores/avenues like Aave and  Sushi to make transactions. 
This gamified visual experience will allow new users to better comprehend the difference between these dapps and their IRL counterparts.
Like AAVE -> Bank and Sushi -> Binance/CEX . 
Imagine a world where you can play to earn in a battle royale game betting on your skill , 
then swap the same crypto winnings in the metaverse itself .Then visit your NFT museum to witness 
them in full 3-D glory . All in a trustless ,decentralized manner ,just using your crypto wallet . 
No email , no dox ,just plain simple AAA gaming experience .

# How it's made
Project Vinland is built on Unity frontend, using ChainSafe web3 APIs to interact with the Ethereum 
and Polygon blockchains and languages like C#, Solidity and Blendr. We used AAVE and Balancer's smart
contracts to try and implement their defi functionality in-game. Although it was challenging implementing
logic in C# (no prior exp), we are pleased with the progress and learning.
